This is my professional landing page, designed with a **Hacker/Cyberpunk** aesthetic to reflect my expertise in **Backend Engineering** and **Application Security (AppSec)**. The project has been optimized to provide an immersive, secure, and high-performance experience.

## 🛡️ AppSec Highlights

As a security-focused professional, this project is not just about visuals; it follows best protection practices:

- **XSS Mitigation (Cross-Site Scripting)**: The internationalization (i18n) system uses `textContent` instead of `innerHTML` to prevent malicious script execution via data attributes.
- **Secure Navigation**: All external links use `rel="noopener noreferrer"` to prevent *tab-nabbing* attacks and protect referrer privacy.
- **Contact Obfuscation**: Implementation of basic protections against automated email and phone number scrapers.

## ⚡ Performance & UX

- **Optimized Animations**: The **Matrix Canvas** effect and **Neon Cursor** utilize `requestAnimationFrame` to ensure 60 FPS with low CPU/Battery consumption.
- **Accessibility (A11y)**:
  - Use of `aria-labels` on all interactive elements without text (social icons).
  - Smart disabling of the custom cursor on *touch* devices to avoid interfering with native usability.
- **Internationalization (i18n)**: Native support for Portuguese (PT) and English (EN) with state persistence.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** (Semantic)
- **CSS3** (Variables, Grid, Flexbox, Complex Animations)
- **JavaScript** (Vanilla JS, DOM API, Canvas API)
- **GitHub Pages** (Continuous Deployment)
